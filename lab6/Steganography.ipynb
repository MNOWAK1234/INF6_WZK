    "### Questions:\n",
    "1. Is this method of hiding information in an image resistant to attacks and attempts to destroy the embedded message?\n",
    "2. Propose attacks on the embedded message.\n",
    "3. What is the size of the message that we can hide in an image/graphic file?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers:\n",
    "1. The method of hiding information in an image using least significant bit (LSB) steganography is not inherently resistant to attacks and attempts to destroy the embedded message. Since only the least significant bits of the image pixels are modified, the embedded message can potentially be detected and altered through various means, such as statistical analysis, visual inspection, or targeted attacks aimed at manipulating the LSBs. Moreover, common image processing techniques like compression or resizing can inadvertently alter or remove the embedded message.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Some potential attacks on the embedded message include:\n",
    "   - Statistical analysis: Analyzing the frequency distribution of pixel values or LSB changes in the image to detect anomalies indicative of hidden data.\n",
    "   - Compression: Applying lossy compression algorithms (e.g., JPEG) to the image may introduce artifacts that alter or remove the embedded message.\n",
    "   - Watermark removal: Attempting to remove watermarks or hidden messages using specialized software or algorithms designed for image manipulation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. The size of the message that can be hidden in an image or graphic file depends on factors such as the resolution of the image, the bit depth of the color channels, and the amount of available LSBs per pixel. In general, the capacity for hiding data using LSB steganography is limited by the number of pixels in the image and the number of LSBs that can be modified without significantly altering the image's visual quality. As a rough estimate, for a typical high-resolution image with 24-bit color depth (8 bits per channel), the message size that can be hidden may range from a few kilobytes to several megabytes, depending on the image's dimensions and characteristics.\n"
